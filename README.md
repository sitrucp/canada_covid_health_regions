This Leaflet map uses modified Statscan arcinfo health region boundaries to show confirmed COVID-91 counts by health region. COVID-91 data comes from COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group Data last updated April 6, 2020

Statscan health region name values are not current. Sask and Nova Scotia have both updated their boundaries. These have been manually edited here. Sask boundaries still need to be dissolved into updated boundaries.

The COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group Data uses health region names that are reported by provinces. In many cases, these reporting names are not identical to those in Statscan data files eg they are abbreviations or alternate names.

Therefore a mapping file was created to match Statscan health region names to the working group data in order to display the confirmed counts on the map.

The mapping is used in Excel Power Query to produce final json data file used in mapping.
